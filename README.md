#Task
===========

Imagine you are going to build an application to showcase your personal Movie collection. At the heart of this we will need to model a number of entities, although for this task we are only interested in Movies and Actors.

Therefore, create a number of PHP classes that represent these entities and satisfy the following criteria.

1. Each entity must have a unique identifier.
2. The Movie entity must hold the title, runtime and release date.
3. The Actor entity must hold the name and date of birth.
4. For all properties consider validation of the values.
5. Each entity must contain a method that returns its data as JSON.
6. Also provide methods for retrieving the values of each property individually.
7. Movies must hold a collection of Actors and the characters being portrayed.
8. The Movie entity requires a method of retrieving all Actors ordered by descending age.

When creating these classes remember that we are looking for you to showcase your knowledge and understanding of PHP and OOP.
